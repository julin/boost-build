Make machines with different versions:
ubuntu12.04 gcc-4.4 - gcc-4.7, clang3.0-3.3
ubuntu14.04 gcc-4.8 - gcc-5.1, clang3.4-3.6

Make a script that will start them sequentially, based on json settings

Script run
update git repo
create docker instance of correct machine
Create a non-union partition on the docker instance
rsync git repo from server to new partition
set temp variable to new partition
build info.html
start run.py with appropriate variables
